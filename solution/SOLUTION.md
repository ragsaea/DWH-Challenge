# DWH Coding Challenge

## Solution Summary & thinking

      # 1
         Doing Loop list to concatenate each data on each folder then Im Visualize each of table and have Visualize merge 3 of them into 1 table so i have easier read transaction historical 
      # 2 
         Reuse Code on first solution, i add a coloumn on the table, thats has value of impacted updated main data coloumn
      # 3
         Describe thats im notice and fun fact
      # 4 
         Im thinking do precisely readme.md that i can but still retain some function or spinoff that i like to retain some code thats too waste to erase. This opportunity really push me to explore what is docker, why docker is important to ETL env etc


## Solution thinking bout architecture
   #how to run your solution end-to-end in a Docker container

         Im think thats i need to minimize some manual works for end to end this ETL archi, because i need to push my works into github as checkpoints and then pull every new version (if i want but actually im using local) then compile it to app.py so i can do 'docker compose up' and edit text on requirement for module sync purpose, lastly open http://localhost:8000/. I think thats too many step that i need to take even for smallest edit, i need to push, pull, edit app.py and edit text and do some cmd to 'docker compose up' and open localhost. So, i still need moar of knowledge and practice wokwokwowkowkw. Thankyou

Sincerely,

Ragsa
